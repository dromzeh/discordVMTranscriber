A Discord bot that can transcribe and translate Discord Voice Messages.

- Uses the DeepL API for translation and Google's Speech Recognition API for transcription.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- discord.py
- pydub
- speech recognition
- deepl

Run the following:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation

> **Note**
> Bot requires Intents to be enabled in the developer portal & an API key for the DeepL API.

- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/dromzeh/vmt.git`
- Rename the `config.example.json` file to `config.json` inside `src/config` and fill in the necessary values (See [Configuration](#configuration)) 

Once the configuration file has been filled, you may run the bot using one of the following methods:

### Native Installation

- Install the requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run the bot inside the `/src` folder: `python main.py`

### Docker Installation (Easier)

Assuming `docker` and `docker-compose` are installed

```bash
docker-compose -f compose.yaml up
```

## Usage

- To use the bot, simply reply to a voice message with the `transcribe` command. The bot will transcribe the voice message and post the transcription as a reply, if you don't reply, the bot will find the most recent voice message in the channel and transcribe it instead.
- If you want to automatically translate the text, you can just add the language code as an argument, such as : `vmt transcribe es` for Spanish, full list is available at `vmt languages` or [here](#language-code-list).
- The bot will then automatically translate the text using the DeepL API.

### Configuration

The config.json file contains the following fields:

- `discord_token`: Your Discord bot token.
- `deepl_api_key`: Your DeepL API key.
- `language_codes`: A dictionary of language codes and their corresponding language names.
